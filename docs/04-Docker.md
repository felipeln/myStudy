## What is docker?

Docker is an container platform that allows you to separate your applications from your infrastructure, so you can develop without need to have an heavy infrastructure installed on your computer.

Docker uses an technology to isolate your infrastructure in containers, where each container will group the application and its dependencies.

All containers will share the same kernel, the kernel where the docker is running.
