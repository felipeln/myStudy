# **My Study** ðŸ“’ 

This repository is where im going to document all my study and notes on my journey through learning "zero-to-hero" on Web development, this might not be in order but may can help others to know how my learning journey is going.

During the study of a new thing, i will be reading, practicing and testing the code and through this process make some notes that i will disponibilize here on this repository.

This repository may help someone but it is only to make my learning journey registered.
